					Super trouper beams are gonna blind me But I won't feel blue Like I always do 'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you I was sick and tired of everything When I called you last night from Glasgow All I do is eat and sleep and sing Wishing every show was the last show (wishing every show was the last show) So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming (glad to hear you're coming) Suddenly I feel all right (And suddenly it's gonna be) And it's gonna be so different

					<p class="project_text">Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.</p>

					<p class="project_text">Her eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair. They were thick and almost horizontal, emphasizing the depth of her eyes. She was rather handsome than beautiful. Her face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features. Her manner was engaging.</p>

He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. It didn't want to go away and, if he was honest with himself, he didn't want it to.</p>
