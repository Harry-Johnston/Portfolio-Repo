# Harry's Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my portfolio repo. It was built using a HTML SCSS and Javascript.

This was the first major project I built and so presented many challenges as told by the multiple iterations it has gone through. The core idea was to use UX/UI principles from a dark mode site to ensure the site was always comfortable to read and to provide a classy backdrop for my future projects.

Late in the project I introduced the use of SCSS via a SASS compiler as it allowed me to use variables for the colours as well as the option for mixins and nesting should i want to fundamentally restructure in the future. I also utilised my newly aquired JS skills to try provide a bit more engagement to the site. My goal with the JS was to keep it light and limited to ensure it didn't become a distraction from the purpose of the site.

In the future I am looking to add a proper back-end to allow a contact form to be deployed and potentially a unique visitor + error log to keep an eye on site traffic.
